## Harry Potter Quiz Game

This is our first team task on course. We have to use API (and all the things we learned before like html, css and js) so we decided to create a quiz about Harry Potter.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users can tests themselves in 3 game modes:

- Students: Do you know Hogwarts student?
- Houses: Do you know to which house students has been assigned by The Sorting Hat? 
- Staff: Do you recognize equally well Hogwarts staff?

But it's not as easy as you think. We have 3 difficulty levels:
- easy: no time limit
- medium: you have 1 minute and +1 point for every correct answer
- hard: you have 30 seconds and you can get -1 point for every wrong aswer

Good Luck! :)
