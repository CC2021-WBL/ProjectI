## Overview

### The challenge

Users can tests themselves in 3 game modes:

- Students: Do you know Hogwarts student?
- Houses: Do you know to which house students has been assigned by The Sorting Hat? 
- Staff: Do you recognize equally well Hogwarts staff?

But it's not as easy as you think. We have 3 difficulty levels:
- easy: no time limit
- medium: you have 1 minute and +1 point for every correct answer
- hard: you have 30 seconds and you can get -1 point for every wrong aswer

Good Luck! :)
